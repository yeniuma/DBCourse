In our mid-term assignment, we aim to create an information page on video games. The database will include some of the more famous games, as well as information on customers and staff. Important characteristics and information related to the games are stored in the database, such as the genre, platform, availability, their prices. The site provides the possibility to view various data about the games. It will also be possible to use the site as a shopping platform, to buy games on sale, and to find out which platform (Steam, Origin, Epic Games,...) a game is available on at any given time, so that the customer can make an informed choice.
